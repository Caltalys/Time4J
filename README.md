Time4J
======

Advanced date, time and interval library for Java

Motivation:
-----------

Time4J is thought as a complete and high-end replacement for old java classes around java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar and java.text.SimpleDateFormat. This project is also intended as first-class alternative to the popular libraries JodaTime and its successor JSR-310 (Threeten) since the target audience of Time4J will not only be business Java developers, but also developers with a more scientific background (for example extended time scale support including leap seconds or historically accurate dates).

Although the new JSR-310 (built in Java 8) is certainly a very useful library for many business developers it also has some severe and intentional limitations. Time4J intends to fill all gaps in the future so justifying its co-existence.

Please have a look at the version of this file on the master branch for gathering further informations. 

Note: The version v3.43 is the last version of this level6-branch (unless future tzdb-syntax-changes might require an update).
